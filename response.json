Zoomed in, there is a tendency to lose one's sense of the overall geometry. Local constellations of vertices and triangles present as microspaces in themselves, abstracted and broken up. \n\nUsing 3D models from my archives of generative sketches, Geometry Dreams are rendered snapshots of such accidental spaces. Color manipulated to further enhance the sense of perceptual space, depth cues of lights and shading are sometimes distorted until the image becomes a color field. Other images, more true to their origin as rendering, depict structures with an aesthetic that might be described as \"Algo Brutalism\".\n\n2023, 4500x6000px PNG, Marius Watz @mariuswatz",
